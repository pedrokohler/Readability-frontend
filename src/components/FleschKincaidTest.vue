                The Flesch–Kincaid readability tests are readability tests designed to indicate how difficult a 
                passage in English is to understand. There are two tests, the Flesch Reading Ease, and the 
                Flesch–Kincaid Grade Level. Although they use the same core measures (word length and sentence length), 
                they have different weighting factors.

                The results of the two tests correlate approximately inversely: a text with a comparatively high score 
                on the Reading Ease test should have a lower score on the Grade-Level test. Rudolf Flesch devised the 
                Reading Ease evaluation; somewhat later, he and J. Peter Kincaid developed the Grade Level evaluation 
                for the United States Navy.

                "The Flesch–Kincaid" (F–K) reading grade level was developed under contract to the U.S. Navy in 1975 by 
                J. Peter Kincaid and his team. Related U.S. Navy research directed by Kincaid delved into high-tech 
                education (for example, the electronic authoring and delivery of technical information),
                usefulness of the Flesch–Kincaid readability formula, computer aids for editing tests, illustrated formats 
                to teach procedures, and the Computer Readability Editing System (CRES).
